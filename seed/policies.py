"""Dev-scale policy doc templates.

These ~15 docs are placeholders for the full drafted help-center corpus
(~600 to 800 docs at full scale, drafted by a model and validated against the
facts sheet; see the Module 1 outline, Lecture 3.1). At dev scale a template
function renders them straight from facts.yaml so the corpus and the database
cannot disagree. Every number in every body is declared in the doc's front
matter, and seed/validate.py checks those declarations against facts.yaml.
